### Conclusion


- Customers who used month to month contract are most likely to churn. There is a probability that it is easier to churn within months than yearly subcriptions.
- Many customers stated that their reason to churn is because their monthly charges are high. This statement is also correct based on the analysis
- High value customers tend to use various services 
- Customers who just joined are mostly in younger age, and joined only for phone services and internet for their phone (not with fiber optic etc). Their monthly charge is also much lower than those who churned.
